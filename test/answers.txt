1.Compile time is the time at which the source code converted into byte code.

  Run time is the time at which executable code is started running.

4.Method is set of code which runs when it is called.
  syntax: public static return-type method-name(){

5.Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data together into single unit. We can achive this by using access specifiers.
  
  example
  RechargeTester.java
  Recharge.java
  
  
6.Array is collection of elements which are of same data type.
  
  example
  ArrayTester.java
  
7. CountryName.java


8.Method overloading is a feature that two or more methods can have same syntax but differ in parameters(number of parameters or type of parameters or change in sequence).
  
  examples
  HumanTester.java
  Human.java
  
  DressTester.java
